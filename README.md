This repository contains a simple PHP script demonstrating an undefined variable notice and its solution. The bug arises when a function attempts to use variables without proper checks for their existence. The solution involves adding checks to ensure that variables are defined before being used.  This is a common error in PHP that often occurs when working with functions receiving potentially null or undefined arguments. Understanding how to correctly handle this scenario is important for robust PHP development.
